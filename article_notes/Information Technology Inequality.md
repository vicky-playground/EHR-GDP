## The compoundness and sequentially of digital inequality
### Abstract
- **Compound digital exclusion** -- whether a person lacking digital skills also lack other skills.
- **Sequential digital exclusion** -- a lower  level of digital skills leads to lower  levels of engagement with the internet.

### Introduction
- Internet access and skills are often treated as indicators of digital inclusion, but attempts to chart gaps remain scarce.
- Existing research suggest internet use confer greater benefits who already have greater resources offline.

### Discussions and Conclusions
- The study finds evidence of compound and sequential digital inequality among Dutch internet users.
- The relationship between uses and outcomes are also very strong outside of the domain.
- Sequential digital exclusion runs from all skills to tangible outcomes.
- Disadvantages in digital skills also result in social exclusion and lower self-actualization.
- The findings suggest the internet magnifies existing social inequalities and divisions. The more resources a person has, the more  the internet delivers.
