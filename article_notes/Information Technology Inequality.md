## The compoundness and sequentially of digital inequality
### Abstract
- **Compound digital exclusion** -- whether a person lacking digital skills also lack other skills.
- **Sequential digital exclusion** -- a lower  level of digital skills leads to lower  levels of engagement with the internet.

### Introduction
- Internet access and skills are often treated as indicators of digital inclusion, but attempts to chart gaps remain scarce.
- Existing research suggest internet use confer greater benefits who already have greater resources offline.

### Discussions and Conclusions
- The study finds evidence of compound and sequential digital inequality among Dutch internet users.
- The relationship between uses and outcomes are also very strong outside of the domain.
- Sequential digital exclusion runs from all skills to tangible outcomes.
- Disadvantages in digital skills also result in social exclusion and lower self-actualization.
- The findings suggest the internet magnifies existing social inequalities and divisions. The more resources a person has, the more  the internet delivers.

## Health Information Technology and Equity: Applying History's Lessons To Tomorrow's Innovations
### Abstract
- Health IT implementation can have unintended consequences of widening disparities by disproportionately benefiting advantaged populations.
- Address community needs, benefit under-served children, adolescents, and caregivers with the potential to yield more equitable healthcare IT.
### Defining health equity
- Equity -- people get what they need, not just what everyone else is getting.
- Health disparities -- preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to achieve optimal health experienced by socially disadvantaged racial, ethnic, and other population groups and communities.
### Health Information Technology and Social Determinants of Health
- Healthcare disparities are driven by social disparities both upstream (how groups live) and downstream (individual factors).
- Demonstrated disparities in information access (e.g. EHR stored in English requires the user to have fast internet and understand what they have signed.)
- Interventions can maintain or widen existing disparities. For example, the Smoke Cession and Back to Sleep campaigns are favor affluent families.
### Health Care and Digital Disparities
- The HITECH Act authors were aware that the new initiative can extend the disparities inherited from the 90s.
#### _Health IT Disparities and Use by Patients_
- Studies show patient portal is most used by white, women, young, English-speakers, and ensured. Other ethnicities are much less likely to enroll in the patient portal.
- Similarly for monitoring software, white people are much more likely to use and continuous than black people.
#### _Health IT Disparities and Use by Clinicians_
- Reducing health disparities is one of the stated reasons for EHR attestations. However, research has shown mixed results, with most advancements being patient safety.
- AI has the tendency to overbook no-show patients into overbooked slots. These patients overwhelmingly come from lower socioeconomic demographics.
### Conclusion
- Health disparities are widespread with impact on children and families.
- Narrowing disparities can be achieved  by embracing approaches that places marginalized patients at the center of health IT design.
