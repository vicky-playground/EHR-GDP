## Capacity building for health inequality monitoring in Indonesia: enhancing the equity orientation of country health information systems
7. Indonesia expressed interest in incorporating health inequality monitoring into its national health information system in 2014, after WHO SDG goals workshops.

### Background
8. WHO advocate nations should have the following capacities:
	- Knowledge
		- Components of health inequality monitoring
		- Approaches and challenges in health inequality monitoring and components
		- Process to follow to report and disseminate health inequality information
	- Skills
		- Mapping data sources
		- Preparing dis-aggregated data from raw household survey data sets
		- Importing dis-aggregated data into the Health Equity Assessment Toolkit Plus (HEAT Plus)
		- Interpreting health equity data using HEAT Plus
		- Drafting a national report on the state of health inequality
		- Develop peer-reviewed manuscripts in health inequality monitoring in the national context

## Digital Health and Inequalities in Access to Health Services in Bangladesh: Mixed Methods Study
### Abstract
- Examins the implications of digital health on access to healthcare in Bangladesh. The paper uses surveys from 854 hoursholds, 20 focus groups.
- The results found 90.3% of households own electronic devices, but only 7.2% uses them to access health information serivces. Among them, middle-aged, female, less educated, and poorer  people are less likely to access healthcare.

### Introduction
- There is an assumption that digital health contributes to equitable access to health care, especially in the LMICs. However, there is evidence of "digital divide" separating the socio-demographic.
### Conclusion
- Respondents avoid mHealth initiatives because of lack of human resources and technological capabilities.
- Access is at the intersection of social determinants. There is the lack of social acknowledgement for need to access healthcare, people may lack the language sophitication to access the software, etc.
- Some social groups will have more access to healthcare because of better access to health, technology, and general literacy.

## Federal Investment in Health Information Technology: How to Motivate It?
### Abstract
1. Healthcare market failures include inefficient standard making, problems with coordination among local providers to optimize care, and inability to measure quality accurately.

### Full text
- HIT innovations are usually made in service of inefficient system (revenue enhancement) or used less  effectively than they should. For example, EHRs had a slow adoption rate, while stand-alone software for improving the bottom-line were rapidly adopted.
- Health compares poorly with other industries in terms of IT investment and adoption.
	- low rate of IT investment (5% increase per employee per year, rather  than >10% for other industries)
	- No champion firms to provide  overwhelming competitive pressure to upgrade efficiency (e.g. Walmart's inventory)
	- Integration-hindering fragmented system of providers
- HIT is adding only 1% productivity growth per year. The top IT industries (e.g. telecoms and securities) experience 4%. Other strong industries (e.g. wholesale and retail) experience 1.5-2%.
- The biggest problem is the government, as the biggest stakeholder, has done nothing to set standards or improve quality.
- **Market making** -- through Medicare, government can push for standards and overcome the market first-mover disadvantages.
- **Quality Measurements** -- the market has been reluctant to invest because quality measurements can expose the providers' inefficiencies, and there is lack of indicators for consumers to decide what is good.
- Gains would be 6% to 8% productivity improvements, with cumulative $6-$11 trillion over 15 years.

## Global digital divide: influence of socioeconomic, governmental, and accessibility factors on information technology
- For developed nations, technology factors are most strongly associated with scientific publications, FDI, percentage of females in the labor force, and education variables. For developing countries, technology are strongly associated with FDI, government prioritization, and education.

### Conclusion
- Creative and educated workforce perform more R&D contributes to higher levels of technology utilization.

## Health literacy, health inequality and a just healthcare system
### Abstract
- Poor health literacy should be understood as a fundamental injustice of the healthcare system.
- Proposals:
	1. universial precautions that presume limited health literacy for all
	2. Expanded use of technology to support commounication
	3. clinincal incentives to account for limited health literacy

## Health Information Technology: One Step At a Time
### Abstract
- Focusing on a limited set  of near-term objectives will build trust, confer near-term benefits, and create the building blocks required to harness the altruistic and entrepreneurial motivations most likely to create future healthcare delivery systems.
### Introduction
- Encourage greater EHR adoption and systems that talk to each other.
- All too often, costs have greater emphasis than commitment. Cultural and human contributions to success are ignored.
- Focusing on building bureaucracies will result in systems that only work when all systems are tightly integrated with each other (impossible).
### Increased Federal IT Investment: Reasons for Optimism
- The program is designed to place working systems that look after patient health first, rather than implementing technology for the sake of it.
- Shift to foundational activities emphasize service quality rather than data possession.
- Common priorities have emerged after years of discussion.
- Shift in emphasis from practitioner compliance to patient outcomes.
- Shift to component certification allows for confidence in the product and more useful compared to certify systems that have few use cases.
- The funding structure promotes different jurisdictions to move towards a common architecture. However, systems must be in place for the workflows to be sustained after the funding runs out.
- Ongoing research and standardizing norms.
### Concluding Comments
- Choose the evolutionary course rather than unrealistic aspirations.

## Interventions for promoting information and communication technologies adoption in  healthcare professionals
### Abstract
- **Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)** -- digital and analogue technologies that facilitate the capturing, processing, storage, and exchange of information via electronic communications.
### Plain Language Summary
- Strategies include:
	- Training in groups for professionals to use ICT
	- One-on-one training for professionals to use ICT
	- Provide training materials
- The literature suggest some ways may be successful. However, the success of these strategies are uncertain and more more studies are needed.

## Meaningful Use: Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs
- Physicians must use certified EHR technology (CEHRT) and demonstrate meaningful use through attestation.
- CMS announced they will be lenient in 2017 due to delays in publishing guidelines.

## Organisational issues in the implementation and adoption of health information technology innovations: an interpretative review
### Abstract
- Implementations of health information technologies are difficult due to inter-related technical, social, and organisational factors.
- Conducted systematic review of empirical literature between 1997 and 2010. Found dimensions are inter-related, requiring balancing of strategic implementation decisions. Organizational issues are crucially important, but are yet to receive attention. 
### Introduction
- The field of studying HIT integration encompasses human factors, human-computer interface, and behaviors.
- Bodies of knowledge surrounding organizational issues in HIT innovation:
	- **Human factors/system ergonomics** -- the science of understanding human capability and their applications to design.
	- **Organizational/occupational/social psychology** -- application of psychological theories to workplace issues.
	- **Management and organizational change** -- identify how to change from current state to desired future state. Usually focused on identifying barriers and facilitators.
	- **Information systems** -- the use of IT in organizations and society. Often interfaces with World Systems Theory.
- Theoretical approaches conceptualizing interaction between technology, humans, and organizations:
	- **Diffusion of innovations** -- how innovation spread across organizations over time.
	- **Normalization process theory** -- how complex interventions are incorporated into day-to-day work.
	- **Sensemaking** -- individuals try to make sense of status quo. Assumes organizations are "talked into action".
	- **Social shaping of technology** -- studies the macro-environmental factors influencing technology and their implementation.
	- **Socio-technical change** -- conceptualizes changes as non-linear, unpredictable, and context-dependent.
	- **Technology acceptance model** -- individual adoption is determined by attitude, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use.
	- **The notion of fit** -- how social, technological, and work processes factor into isolation.
### Results
#### Paper summaries
**Alexander and Staggers 2009** -- System effectiveness depends on: simple to use interface, include users in design and development, effective navigation for existing workflows, impact on system workload, customization, flexibility, and ease of learning.
**Boonstra and Broekhuis 2010**
- Identified the following inter-related categories:
	- _Financial_ -- the cost of investment and ROI.
	- _Technical_ -- the skills needed to implement and use the system.
	- _Time_ -- disruption to existing workflow.
	- _Psychological_ -- does the new system improve patient outcomes and professional control.
	- _Social_ -- relationship with other parties and support from the government.
	- _Legal_ -- data may be illegally accessed, compliance with regulations.
	- _Organizational_ -- does the technology scale, and benefit which type of organization.
	- _Change process_ -- organizational culture needs to be supportive with proper incentives.
**Gagnon et al. 2010a** -- use clinical information retrieval technologies for clinical intervention. The study found mixed impact, as 3 indicated positive impact and 4 did not show significant impact.
**Gagnon et al. 2010b** -- barriers and facilitators to HIT adoption. Found inter-related technological, human, and organizational factors.
- Facilitators -- benefits, ease of use, compatibility, support, user involvement.
- Barriers -- design, technical concerns, time, lack of compatibility with existing practices, validity, cost, compliance, patient interaction, social attitude, change in tasks, and resources.
**Greenhalgh et al. 2004** -- divided research traditions into _early diffusion_, _later diffusion_, and _management literature_. The framework suggest several key aspects to adoption:
- Nature of the innovations
- Adoption strategies
- Role of effective communications in introducing innovations
- The importance of organizational and environmental context
- How implementation is done effectively and change sustained
- The role of external agencies
**Gruber et al. 2009** -- Categorized HIT implementation based on system, user, management, and patient outcomes.
- System outcomes -- user-friendly, performance, functionality, integration.
- User outcomes -- user acceptance of the system and whether it improves patient care.
- Management outcomes -- data for secondary users and facilitate decision-making.
- Patient outcomes -- Satisfaction with the provider.
**Gurses and Xiao 2006** -- divided tools into _patient-centric information tools_, _decision-support tools_, and _process-oriented tools_. Suggest use process-oriented tools to improve impact. Important technical features: summary & display up-to-date information, multi-user support, mobile technology, checklists, informal communication.
**Keshavjee et al. 2006** -- high incident failure in EMR implementation. Technology is implemented over certain period of time, strong leadership is important, implementation is a dynamic and evolving learning process.
- Factors divided into _people_, _process_, and _technology_. Divides implementation into _pre-implementation_, _implementation_, and _post-implementation_.
- Factors important in pre-implementation phase: governance (senior management), leadership (PMs), stakeholders (organizational readiness for change), software (meets organization requirement), integration (integrates with existing systems), usability.
- Factors important during implementation phase: fit with clinical workflows, training, working relationship with the supplier, support, communication and feedback, address confidentiality & security.
- Factors important in post-implementation phase: technical support, adoption incentives.
**Ludwick and Doucette 2009** -- identify lessons from EMR implementation.
- Social-technical factors were most important for successful implementation.
- Barriers: perceived negative impact on safety, privacy, professional relationship, implementation time, and costs. User resistance if they perceive the change is imposed.
- Mitigating factors: good project management and leadership.
- Experience (e.g. with computers, vendor management), usability, and training are important for implementation success.
- Cost concerns common to adoption.
**Mair et al. 2007** -- technology design, professional interactions, and organizational factors are important.
- Key barriers: adequate information management, inadequate inter-agency cooperation, intrusive technology, cost, lack of testing.
- Key facilitators: positive cooperation, flexibility, ease of use, organizational willingness, ability to order information.
**Robert et al. 2010** -- Review of organizational factors and processes affecting HIT. Importance of: interaction between groups in organizations, organizational history, power relationships, professionalism, influence of social groups, key individuals, between organizations, and the environment.
**Yarbrough and Smith 2007** -- resistance by users is often the greatest barrier to EMR implementation. Other barriers include lack of empirical evidence of effectiveness, financial incentives, disruptions to existing practices, organizational support, and technical features (e.g. reliability).
**Yusof et al. 2007** -- critical adoption factors: technology, human, organization information, organization environment. Hierarchical structures are detrimental to implementation.
#### Technical Characteristics
- The majority of end users are not adverse to technology, but are adverse to systems they perceive as interfering with their values. The new technology should be at least as fast as the previous system.
### Conclusions
- Previous experiences were difficult to generalize. However, HIT agenda is coming to the forefront due to consensus within the field that technology advancement does not occur within a vacuum. 

## The role of information and communication technologies in socioeconomic development: towards a multi-dimensional framework
### Abstract
- Conceptual framework that considers 4 dimensions that impact socioeconomic development: policy, business, technology, and society. 

## The socioeconomic aspects of information technology for health care with emphasis on radiology
### Introduction
- The barriers to rapid and widespread development of practically useful HIT are exclusively related to human factors.
- The intrinsically handcrafted nature of health care work combined with high degrees of complexity makes it impossible to computerize to the same degree as other industries.
- The informatics community should return authority back to the physicians and nurses.
- Computerization reports: Institute of Medicine report 1991, Institute of Medicine report 2001, and HIT initiative.
- The consensus so far has been HIT has been costly with few beneficial results. This failure can mainly be traced to socio-cultural factors. HIT was an effort to industrialize healthcare like manufacturing.
- Rather than trying to replace existing processes, HIT should complement and streamline existing ones.
### Conclusion
- IT disrupts existing social structures and clinical practices. At worst, it creates adverse outcomes for patients despite the good intentions.

## Stimulating the Adoption of Health Information Technology
1. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009) mandated $19 billion to promote HIT and EHRs.
1. Barriers to HIT:
	1. 17% of doctors and 10% of hospitals had EHR
	2. significant costs, lack of financial return, technical and logistical challenges
	3. Privacy and security
1. Starting 2011, Medicare physicians receive extra payments for the "meaningful use" of "certified" EHR . These payments total $18,000 for the first year, $15,000 for physicians adopting it after 2013 and lower for 2014 onward. The payments ceases in 2016.
1. This means the following:

| year | payment |
| ---- | ---- |
| 2011 | $44,000 |
| 2013 | $27,000 |

1. The cost of implementing EHR comes at $40,000.
1. Medicaid physicians seeing 30% or higher medicaid physicians also receive subsidies. However, this cuts them off from the  Medicare program.
2. Physicians not using EHR by 2015 will lose 1% of their Medicare fees, 2% in 2016, and 3% in 2017.
3.
