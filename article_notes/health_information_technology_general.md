## Do health information technology investments impact hospital financial performance and productivity?
### Introduction
1. Health information technology expenses are positively correlated with hospitals' return on assets and productivity.
1. Additional benefits from intermediate processe are also generated from investment.
1. Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act has greatly increased HIT adoption. By 2015, 84% of hosptials have at least a basic EHR system.
1. The  _Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)_ offers incentive payments to hospitals that can demostrate meaningful use of EHR technology (e.g. quality, safety, efficiency, better clinical outcomes).
2. Despite the presumption of effectiveness, the expected efficiencies from HIT remain elusive.
### Conclusion
12. HIT expenses are directly and positively associated with hospital ROA and productivity.



## Effects of health information technology on patient outcomes:  a systematic review
1. 36% studies found health IT had benefits on patient safety outcomes, 62% showed it was not significant, and 1% said it had determimental effects.
1. IT has been considered a potential mechanism to support clinical care. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) program has seen billions of dollars invested in it.
1. Many previous systematic reviews focused on one specific health IT (_clinical decision support_, outpatient, inpatient, intensive care, pediatrics, geriatrics, antibiotic medications, anticoagulant therapy, lab testing, or treatment of hypertension, adverse drug events).
18. Need to understand how IT is impacting patients.

## Information Technology and Productivity: Evidence from Country-Level Data
- Estimate inter-country production function relating IT and non-IT inpts to GDP output. The panel data from 36 countries between 1985-1993 shoed that returns on IT investment in developed countries is positive and significant, while returns on IT investment in developing countries are not statistically significant.
