## Capacity building for health inequality monitoring in Indonesia: enhancing the equity orientation of country health information systems
7. Indonesia expressed interest in incorporating health inequality monitoring into its national health information system in 2014, after WHO SDG goals workshops.

### Background
8. WHO advocate nations should have the following capacities:
	- Knowledge
		- Components of health inequality monitoring
		- Approaches and challenges in health inequality monitoring and components
		- Process to follow to report and disseminate health inequality information
	- Skills
		- Mapping data sources
		- Preparing dis-aggregated data from raw household survey data sets
		- Importing dis-aggregated data into the Health Equity Assessment Toolkit Plus (HEAT Plus)
		- Interpreting health equity data using HEAT Plus
		- Drafting a national report on the state of health inequality
		- Develop peer-reviewed manuscripts in health inequality monitoring in the national context

## Digital Health and Inequalities in Access to Health Services in Bangladesh: Mixed Methods Study
### Abstract
- Examins the implications of digital health on access to healthcare in Bangladesh. The paper uses surveys from 854 hoursholds, 20 focus groups.
- The results found 90.3% of households own electronic devices, but only 7.2% uses them to access health information serivces. Among them, middle-aged, female, less educated, and poorer  people are less likely to access healthcare.


## Federal Investment in Health Information Technology: How to Motivate It?
1. Healthcare market failures include inefficient standard making, problems with coordination among local providers to optimize care, and inability to measure quality accurately.

## Global digital divide: influence of socioeconomic, governmental, and accessibility factors on information technology
- For developed nations, technology factors are most strongly associated with scientific publications, FDI, percentage of females in the labor force, and education variables. For developing countries, technology are strongly associated with FDI, government prioritization, and education.

### Conclusion
- Creative and educated workforce perform more R&D contributes to higher levels of technology utilization.


## The role of information and communication technologies in socioeconomic development: towards a multi-dimensional framework
- Conceptual framework that considers 4 dimensions that impact socioeconomic development: policy, business, technology, and society.

## The socioeconomic aspects of information technology for health care with emphasis on radiology
### Introduction
- The barriers to rapid and widespread development of practically useful HIT are exclusively related to human factors.
- The intrinsically handcrafted nature of health care work combined with high degrees of complexity makes it impossible to computerize to the same degree as other industries.
- The informatics community should return authority back to the physicians and nurses.
- Computerization reports: Institute of Medicine report 1991, Institute of Medicine report 2001, and HIT initiative.
- The consensus so far has been HIT has been costly with few beneficial results. This failure can mainly be traced to socio-cultural factors. HIT was an effort to industrialize healthcare like manufacturing.
- Rather than trying to replace existing processes, HIT should complement and streamline existing ones.
### Conclusion
- IT disrupts existing social structures and clinical practices. At worst, it creates adverse outcomes for patients despite the good intentions.

## Stimulating the Adoption of Health Information Technology
1. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009) mandated $19 billion to promote HIT and EHRs.
1. Barriers to HIT:
	1. 17% of doctors and 10% of hospitals had EHR
	2. significant costs, lack of financial return, technical and logistical challenges
	3. Privacy and security
1. Starting 2011, Medicare physicians receive extra payments for the "meaningful use" of "certified" EHR . These payments total $18,000 for the first year, $15,000 for physicians adopting it after 2013 and lower for 2014 onward. The payments ceases in 2016.
1. This means the following:

| year | payment |
| ---- | ---- |
| 2011 | $44,000 |
| 2013 | $27,000 |

1. The cost of implementing EHR comes at $40,000.
1. Medicaid physicians seeing 30% or higher medicaid physicians also receive subsidies. However, this cuts them off from the  Medicare program.
2. Physicians not using EHR by 2015 will lose 1% of their Medicare fees, 2% in 2016, and 3% in 2017.
3.
