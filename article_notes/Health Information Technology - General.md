## Do health information technology investments impact hospital financial performance and productivity?
### Introduction
1. Health information technology expenses are positively correlated with hospitals' return on assets and productivity.
1. Additional benefits from intermediate processe are also generated from investment.
1. Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act has greatly increased HIT adoption. By 2015, 84% of hosptials have at least a basic EHR system.
1. The  _Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)_ offers incentive payments to hospitals that can demostrate meaningful use of EHR technology (e.g. quality, safety, efficiency, better clinical outcomes).
2. Despite the presumption of effectiveness, the expected efficiencies from HIT remain elusive.
### Conclusion
12. HIT expenses are directly and positively associated with hospital ROA and productivity.

## Effects of health information technology on patient outcomes:  a systematic review
1. 36% studies found health IT had benefits on patient safety outcomes, 62% showed it was not significant, and 1% said it had detrimental effects.
1. IT has been considered a potential mechanism to support clinical care. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) program has seen billions of dollars invested in it.
1. Many previous systematic reviews focused on one specific health IT (_clinical decision support_, outpatient, inpatient, intensive care, pediatrics, geriatrics, antibiotic medications, anticoagulant therapy, lab testing, or treatment of hypertension, adverse drug events).
18. Need to understand how IT is impacting patients.

## Information Technology and Productivity: Evidence from Country-Level Data
- Estimate inter-country production function relating IT and non-IT inputs to GDP output. The panel data from 36 countries between 1985-1993 showed that returns on IT investment in developed countries is positive and significant, while returns on IT investment in developing countries are not statistically significant.

## Systematic review: impact of health information technology on quality, efficiency, and costs of medical care
### Abstract
- Benefits identified of using EHR:
	- increased adherence to guideline-based care
	- enhanced surveillance and monitoring
	- decreased  medication errors
- Limitations:
	- small number of institutions
	- heterogeneous systems and incomplete descriptions
	- limited financial and contextual records
- Conclusions:
	- 

## Using health information technology to reduce regional health inequality in Taiwan
### Abstract
- 1.6% of Taiwanese population live in mountainous areas or offshore islands. These areas are difficult to access. The government has been improving healthcare access for people living in these regions, such as digital communications and mobile clinics.
- Advantages of EHR:
	1. _Interhospital information exchange_ -- information can be quickly exchanged between hospitals.
	2. _Correctness_ -- reduce typos and other deficiencies of handwritten records.
	3. _Better management and retrieval_ -- modifications and copying records are tracked.
	4. _Permanent storage_ -- cloud stored records are less susceptible to loss and natural disasters.
	5. _Environmental protection_ -- reduce paper consumption
- Residents of remote areas can use their Insurance Integrated Circuit (IC) cards after visits to metropolitan hospitals, so local clinics can access their medical records and respond accordingly. It also reduces transportation costs and loss of working hours.
- The system was made available in 500 hospitals and 20,000 clinics by 2015.
