## Infrastructure and inequality
### Abstract
- Public investment generate wealth inequality. However, it is dependent on finance policies. There also tradeoffs, with some investments not contributing to inequality in the short run but does in the long run.
- Dependencies:
	- Externalities  impinges on allocation decisions
	- Financing policies
	- The time period of consideration

### Introduction
- Literature agree that public investment yield productivity and growth benefits, while altering ROI for factors and impact wealth and income distribution.
- The link between public infrastructure and inequality is sparse and contradictory. Some papers found public infrastructure correlates with lower inequality. Other studies found access to public infrastructure to correlate with higher inequality.
- The results of the study:
	1. Government spending leads to increase in wealth inequality over time regardless of how it was financed.
	2. The growth-income relationship depends on externalities impinge on allocation decisions, underlying financial policies, and time period of consideration.
	3. Government expenditure increases average welfare but increases dispersion.

## Economic Growth and Inequality:  The Role of Public Investment
### Abstract
- Two frameworks:
	1. **Representative consumer theory of distribution** -- agent heterogeneity originates with wealth endowments.
	2. Agent heterogeneity arises from idiosyncratic productivity shocks and generates an equilibrium in which distributional dynamics drive growth

### Background and Overview
- since 1955, studies on the relationship between inequality and economic growth have been inconclusive. Those who found a negative relationship explains:
	1. Political economy consequences of inequality
	2. negative impact of inequality on education
	3. capital market imperfections and credit constraints
- Those who found positive relationship between inequality and economic growth include:
	1. relative saving propensities of the rich vs. poor
	2. investment indivisibility
	3. incentives
- Both inequality and economic growth are more likely to be representatives of underlying economic forces rather than causal factors of themselves.

### Conclusions
- Analytically, both macroeconomic aggregates and distribution are jointly determined. Substantively, the complexity arises from the multi-dimensionality of the forces impinging on this relationship.
- **This paper focused on the role of public  investment as a determinant of the relationship between the accumulation of physical capital and the degree of wealth and income inequality thus generated**.
- First Model:
	- Public investment increases inequality irrespective of how it is financed. Government investment enhances private capital productivity, stimulating its accumulation, private capital is more unequally distributed among agents than is labor.
	- Consequences of income inequality depends on how public investment is financed and the trade-offs. In the short term, income inequality is dominated by labor-leisure choice and impact on factor returns. Over the long term, it is influenced by wealth and labor income inequality.
- Second Model:
	- Negative relationship between inequality and growth.
	- Government investment impact on equality depends on factor substitutability  embodied in the production function.
