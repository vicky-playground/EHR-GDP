## Economic Growth and Inequality:  The Role of Public Investment
### Abstract
- Two frameworks:
	1. **Representative consumer theory of distribution** -- agent heterogeneity originates with wealth endowments.
	2. Agent heterogeneity arises from idiosyncratic productivity shocks and generates an equilibrium in which distributional dynamics drive growth

### Background and Overview
- since 1955, studies on the relationship between inequality and economic growth have been inconclusive. Those who found a negative relationship explains:
	1. Political economy consequences of inequality
	2. negative impact of inequality on education
	3. capital market imperfections and credit constraints
- Those who found positive relationship between inequality and economic growth include:
	1. relative saving propensities of the rich vs. poor
	2. investment indivisibility
	3. incentives
- Both inequality and economic growth are more likely to be representatives of underlying economic forces rather than causal factors of themselves.

### Conclusions
- Analytically, both macroeconomic aggregates and distribution are jointly determined. Substantively, the complexity arises from the multi-dimensionality of the forces impinging on this relationship.
- **This paper focused on the role of public  investment as a determinant of the relationship between the accumulation of physical capital and the degree of wealth and income inequality thus generated**.
- First Model:
	- Public investment increases inequality irrespective of how it is financed. Government investment enhances private capital productivity, stimulating its accumulation, private capital is more unequally distributed among agents than is labor.
	- Consequences of income inequality depends on how public investment is financed and the trade-offs. In the short term, income inequality is dominated by labor-leisure choice and impact on factor returns. Over the long term, it is influenced by wealth and labor income inequality.
- Second Model:
	- Negative relationship between inequality and growth.
	- Government investment impact on equality depends on factor substitutability  embodied in the production function.

## Infrastructure and inequality
### Abstract
- Public investment generate wealth inequality. However, it is dependent on finance policies. There also trade-offs, with some investments not contributing to inequality in the short run but does in the long run.
- Dependencies:
	- Externalities  impinges on allocation decisions
	- Financing policies
	- The time period of consideration

### Introduction
- Literature agree that public investment yield productivity and growth benefits, while altering ROI for factors and impact wealth and income distribution.
- The link between public infrastructure and inequality is sparse and contradictory. Some papers found public infrastructure correlates with lower inequality. Other studies found access to public infrastructure to correlate with higher inequality.
- The results of the study:
	1. Government spending leads to increase in wealth inequality over time regardless of how it was financed.
	2. The growth-income relationship depends on externalities impinge on allocation decisions, underlying financial policies, and time period of consideration.
	3. Government expenditure increases average welfare but increases dispersion.

## The Effect of the Size and the Mix of Public Spending on Growth and Inequality
### Abstract
- Effects of the size and composition of public spending on long-term growth and inequality. Certain items (public investment & education) boost potential growth, while others (pensions & public subsidies) lower potential growth. Large governments decrease growth.
### Introduction and main findings
- OECD governments spend on average 40% of their GDP on provisioning public goods, services, and transfers. The spending has 2 effects on income:
	- direct impact from the transfers
	- indirect impact due to future growth
- Main findings:
	- Larger governments are associated with lower long-term growth and slows down on productivity catchup.
	- The negative effects of large governments can be offset if the countries have well-functioning governments and spending decentralization.
	- Effective governments promotes equity with no adverse effects on growth. Governments tend to redistribute more.
	- Improving government effectiveness and reduce governments can increase growth and reduce inequality. However, smaller governments redistribute less.
- Spending structure
	- Invest in education and skills yields the largest gains.
	- Increase investment and reduce other forms of spending increases convergence of income and "rising tide lifts all boats".
	- Growth gains from investment gains decrease at high public capital stock due to diminishing returns.
	- Reducing pension spending yields sizable growth gains, but entails trade-offs between different segments of society.
	- Cutting public subsidies boosts growth. However, this delivers large disposable incomes for the rich and no gains for the poor.
	- Spending on family benefits and child care reduces disposable income inequality.
### Conclusion
- The paper emphasize shift to spend on investment and associated with higher growth and benefit for all. Reform of public spending effect is broad and large.
- Government effectiveness is crucial for inclusive  growth. The long-term impact of spending reform depends on the design and implementation.
- Public spending reforms that yield disproportionate benefits to the rich can be complemented by other re-distributive policies.

## The Re-distributive Impact of Government Spending on Education and Health: Evidence from Thirteen Developing Countries in the Commitment to Equity Project
### Abstract
- Analyzes fiscal policy and its link with inequality. Fiscal  policy affect household consumption directly through taxes and transfers, and indirectly through incentives and public goods provision.
- Growth and equity are not at odds. With appropriate policies, countries can achieve more economic growth while maintaining equity.
### Introduction
- Measurement of the value of government  services is the cost of provision. This is not a perfect measurement.
- Government spending progressivity and pro-poor is determined by the concentration coefficient. Spending is _regressive_ when the coefficient is higher than market-income Gini. Spending is _progressive_ when the coefficient is lower than market-income Gini. Spending is pro-poor  when the coefficient is both lower than that market-income Gini and also has a negative value (the per-capita spending is higher the poorer the individual).
- Findings:
	- Total social spending as a share of GDP is at a historical high and increases with gross national income. However, while health spending increases with GDP per-capita, education does not.
	- More unequal countries redistribute more. Redistribution is driven by whether the inequality is driven by whether the inequality is measured in absolute or relative terms.
	- Reduction in inequality is defined as the  _difference between market-income Gini and Gini after redistribution_.
	- Education spending: in 9 countries, education spending is pro-poor, roughly equal in 3, and progressive but not pro-poor in one.
	- Health spending: pro-poor in 5 countries, equal across income distribution in 3, and progressive but not pro-poor in 5.
### Health
- Health spending benefits the poorest 20% in Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, and more. It benefits the richest 20% in El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Indonesia, and Peru more.

### Conclusion
- Spending levels in today's developing countries are generally higher than those in the developed countries when they were at similar levels of development.
- Social spending as a share  of total income increases with GNI per capita. Health spending increases with GNI per capita, but education does not.
- The share of education and health spending accruing to the bottom 20% for most Latin American countries were lower in 2000 than 2010.
- Bolivia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, and Peru the poor are on average net payers in the fiscal system and the post-fiscal income poverty  is higher than market-income poverty. There is less-than-universal access  and inability to use government services in education and health for the poor.
- As long as the quality of the services provided by the government is low, there is still a distortion effect where the rich benefit from the services more.

## The regional allocation of infrastructure investment: the role of equity, efficiency and political factors
### Abstract
- The estimated investment equation is derived from a general specification of the government's objective function.
- Used panel data from Spain, on investment and transportation capital stock. Used a dynamic specification of the equation that allows for slow adjustments and estimated using the GMM methods.
- The results suggest efficiency plays limited role. Regional infrastructure needs and political factors explain the region allocation of infrastructure investment.
### Introduction
- Redistribution of infrastructure investment from one region to another is not random, but has both economic and political reasons.
- The paper selected transportation infrastructure because 1). they are the most relevant infrastructure investment in Spain and 2). the infrastructure that show the greatest impact on production.
- **Cadot et al. (1999)** mostly focused  on interests and lobby groups in regional spending in France.
### Results
- Highlighted conclusions:
	- Economic determines have more explanatory capacity than political variables.
	- The inclusion of _electoral productivity_ variable does not alter the conclusions regarding economic variables.
	- Investment adjusts slowly towards its long-term value.
	- Infrastructure investment is sensitive to per-capita output growth and the coefficients are statistically significant at a conventional level. The central government does not exclusively follow efficiency criteria.
	- Growth in output share of transportation services has a positive and statistically significant impact on investment.
	- The political variables appear with the expected sign. Favor _electoral productivity_ model.
		- _Pivotal representatives_ is positive and significant.
		- Regional parties supporting minority government is significant.
		- Leftist parties is significant.
#### Regional government results
- Infrastructure adjusts slowly to long-run level.
- Coefficient estimated for investment made by other layers is also negative and statistically significant.
- Coefficient of per capita output is 0.146 and 0.211 for transportation and roads.
- The results for infrastructure needs are also similar.
- Variables measuring _electoral productivity_ also have expected effect.
- The results measuring _partisanship and other influences_ is mixed.
#### Final thoughts
- The main difference between the central and regional governments:
	- regional governments need more time to adjust to long-run equilibrium
	- They are more inclined towards efficiency
	- More responsive to infrastructure needs
### Conclusions
- The results suggest both central and regional governments  balance equity and efficiency in allocation. Investment from regional governments seem more towards efficiency. This is possible due to the central government being leftist while not all regions were.
- Technical considerations (e.g. output vehicle share) is also relevant.
- Political considerations plays a role in allocation. Governments invest more in regions where electoral productivity is higher.
